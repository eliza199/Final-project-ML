This is a repository for final project on Skolkovo Machine Learning course.

Here we provided some examples of neural style transfer task using pretrained on ImageNet VGG-19 net.

Also we provided multiple style transfer - a problem, where we transfer style from two input style pictures to content with some weights.

Examples of results of model:
